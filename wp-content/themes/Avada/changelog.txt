Four New Demos To Show The Power of Avada
We have added 4 new demos that are built entirely from our included options. These demos are unique and creatively designed for the specific industries they represent. Best of all, you can import them directly from the WordPress admin and use for your site. They are Avada Fashion, Avada Mobile App, Avada Cafe and Avada Travel.  More coming soon!

New iLightBox Integration With 6 Skins & Additional Options
We have replaced prettyPhoto light box with the faster, more feature rich iLightBox. This new light box comes with 6 design skins that you can easily choose from our theme options panel. In addition, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added new theme options to control the position of the image thumbnail navigation panel. We have also simplified the titles and captions so it is consistent with what you see in the WordPress media section; image titles display as light box titles and image captions display as light box captions.

New WooCommerce List View & Horizontal Product Tab Option
A new "List View" layout option has been added for the WooCommerce shop page. This gives you the option to display products in the standard "Grid" or  new "List" layout.  A new theme option on the WooCommerce tab controls this. When selected, the shop page will display a grid/list icon set which allows your viewer to choose the view for your products on the front end.  In addition, we have added a new option that allows you to choose horizontal tabs for the single product page, in addition to our standard vertical tabs.

New Carousel Design Along With Several New Options
Carousels were given a minor design change that allow the images to span the full width of the container. This allows the navigation arrows/boxes to sit on top of the images. In addition we have added several new options for customization.  Carousels can now be set to autoplay, choose column size, control column spacing all the way down to 0px, use mouse click to drag scrolling, show or hide navigation boxes, show or hide the border.  Each of these options have been added to these elements: image carousel, recent work carousel, WooCommerce product carousel and WooCommerce featured slider. In addition, related posts & projects have the options added to the theme options panel under the "Extras" tab.

NOTE: Due to the new carousel options, we no longer need separate elements for client slider and image carousel. They have been consolidated into one element called "image carousels".  When you update, your client sliders will be converted to image carousels when you open and edit the page.

Over 40 New Theme & Page Options Added
We have added over 40 new theme and page options to help you take your site design further. These options put you in the drivers seat, giving you control over your website.

New Welcome Screen In WordPress Admin
We have added a new Welcome Screen in the WordPress admin that provides a better user experience. It will automatically show after you install Avada, and you can easily access it in the left sidebar of your admin at any time. This new addition has 4 different pages.
- Product registration page - this page allows you to fully register your product to be eligible for free support and auto theme updates. Previously this was located in theme options.
- Support page - contains important links to our support center and resources.
- Install Demos - this is where you can easily import any of our demo content as well as preview a specific demo. Previously this was located in theme options.
- Fusion Plugins - this is where you will be able to view and download new plugins that our team is developing. Very exciting products are on their way!
- System Status - this shows you important information about your sites status and helps the troubleshooting process

Continually Optimized & Refactored Code
Our team has devoted a lot of time and energy into reviewing and optimizing our code. Our refactoring will result in a slimmer, faster version of Avada than ever before. Our motivation for this continuous process is to enhance your workflow experience and ensure code quality stays at a high level. This is a continual effort and will make using Avada more delightful than it already is.

Refactored Header.php file and clean up head
dynamically generated CSS has been outsourced making the head tag of every page much shorter and cleaner.

Refactored sticky header and implemented entirely new sticky header setup
no more jumping in sticky header, no more duplicated menus and menu entries. Smooth transitions from normal header to sticky header. New option to add a unique sticky header logo. Different action hooks added for dev user interaction.

Refactor portfolio templates
all portfolio templates are now controlled by one single file, compressing the portfolio code structure. New option to include image placeholders. Improved filter implementation for infinite scroll. On new loading of items, only those from the selected filter will be shown. New option to load more items via button click. Different action hooks added for dev user interaction.

Refactor blog templates
all blog templates are now controlled by one single file,compressing the needed code and making updates easier. Different action hooks added for dev user interaction.

Refactor blog layouts
better overall code basis. Similar infinite scroll additions as for portfolio layouts. Different action hooks added for dev user interaction.

Refactor footer
overall code cleaning, new footer parallax effect option, new sticky footer option for pages with little content (and thus small overall height). Action hook added for dev user interaction.

Consolidate all retina image css media queries
Cleaned up inconsistencies when retina versions of images would kick in. Now all use the same media query.

General media query issue with side header
Media queries for responsive layouts are now dynamic. That means if a side header layout is used, we no longer use fixed px based media queries, ex: "do this at 800px screen width and below". Since the side header takes up a portion of the available screen width and since that width can be chosen by the user, we calculate the width newly at which mobile media queries need to kick in, so that the content behaves more or less the same as on top header layouts.

Major improvements to feature image loading for various areas of the theme
we have it setup now for lazy loading images. Most prominent place to see are portfolio archive templates, where the pics are not shown all at once when they are all loaded, but are displayed one by one progressively.

New activate developers mode
Quality of life addition for support staff and dev users. All js files are de-bundled and loaded separately, which makes debugging much easier. On the other hand, when disabled, all js files will be merged into one single, auto-minimized js file, which reduces not only amount of bytes that need to be loaded, but also the amount of server requests tremendously.

Improve breadcrumbs setup and also fixed a few breadcrumb issues
breadcrumbs now have their own class and are managed in a single file in one place. OOP architecture improving performance too. Separator between breadcrumbs can be freely chosen now as a theme option. New option to disable the post categories being listed in the breadcrumb path. Parent and child categories are shown correctly now in tree structure.

Automatic disabling features for less files
This can increase performance if you are not using a specific feature. We only load the needed styles now when it is really needed. RTL styles will only be loaded on RTL site, WooCommerce styles only when woo is active, bbpress the same. Responsive styles only if the option is checked.
